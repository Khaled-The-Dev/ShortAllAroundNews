# Short global news
A automatic news blog web app

# Made with:
* Supabase
* ImagineClound Summarize api
* Netlify
* Netlify Function

# Intention:
This project was meant to be private and i wanted to add adsense ads to it "But google refused my app" due to some bs so I made it open source
`Feel free to fork it and reuse it` `But please add you're own touch to it`

# How it works 
First it fetches data from a news api and then it makes a post request with the given news data and then the api summarizes it and then it puts it to the Supabase database

# Note: the code has no comment
